# serve: serve files or folders

stolen from: https://github.com/itang/gohttp with a few additions. 
If the path you specify for serving is a file this will create a tmp folder and serve up a copy of just that single file. I find this useful for when I want to share a file with co-workers but don't want to share the other files in the directory.

It also generates a url to your machine [http://your.ip:port] and copies it your clipboard for easy pasting in your favorite chat client or whatever.

- Linux requires `xclip` or `xsel` to be installed
